# geocode

Geocoding is the process of converting addresses (like "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA") into geographic coordinates (like latitude 37.422 and longitude -122.084).

Using the Mapbox Geocoding API, you can perform forward and reverse geocoding to get location data based on addresses or coordinates.
